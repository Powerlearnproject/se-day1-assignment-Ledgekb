- **Description**: The Agile Manifesto was created in 2001, advocating for flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback in software development. This represented a shift from traditional, rigid methodologies (like Waterfall) to more iterative and adaptive approaches. Agile practices, such as Scrum and Kanban, have since become widely adopted, focusing on delivering functional software quickly and accommodating changes throughout the development process.

These milestones reflect the evolution of software engineering from its inception to modern practices, emphasizing the transition from ad hoc methods to structured, collaborative, and adaptive approaches.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing software applications. It consists of several phases, each with specific tasks and objectives. Here’s a brief explanation of the main phases:

1. **Planning**: This initial phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. Stakeholders gather to discuss requirements and create a plan that outlines timelines, budget, and resources.

2. **Requirements Analysis**: In this phase, detailed requirements are gathered from stakeholders. This includes understanding what the users need from the software, documenting these requirements, and ensuring everyone agrees on them.

3. **Design**: The design phase translates the requirements into a blueprint for the software. This includes creating architectural designs, user interfaces, and data structures. It outlines how the software will work and how its components will interact.

4. **Development**: During this phase, developers start coding the software according to the design specifications. This involves programming, integrating different components, and preparing the software for testing.

5. **Testing**: Once development is complete, the software is tested to identify and fix any defects or issues. This phase ensures the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended. Various types of testing (like unit, integration, and system testing) may be conducted.

6. **Deployment**: After successful testing, the software is deployed to a live environment. This phase involves installing the software and making it available to users. There may be a staged rollout or full deployment depending on the project.

7. **Maintenance**: After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase. This includes updating the software, fixing any new bugs, and adding new features based on user feedback. Maintenance ensures the software continues to function well over time.

These phases provide a framework for managing and guiding software development projects, helping ensure quality and efficiency in delivering software products

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

By implementing these tests at different stages of development, teams can identify and fix issues early, reduce the risk of defects in production, and ensure that the final product meets user expectations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Early detection of bugs helps save costs associated with fixing issues later in the

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
*Prompt Engineering** refers to the process of designing and refining the inputs (or prompts) given to AI models, particularly language models, to elicit the most relevant, accurate, and useful responses. It involves crafting questions or statements in a way that optimally guides the AI's output.

### Importance of Prompt Engineering in Interacting with AI Models:

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Well-structured prompts can lead to more precise and relevant answers. The way a question is phrased can significantly influence the model’s understanding and, consequently, the quality of its response.

2. **Enhanced Relevance**: Effective prompts help focus the AI on the specific context or topic of interest, reducing the chance of receiving irrelevant or off-topic information.

3. **User Experience**: A better user experience is achieved when users can easily obtain the information they need. Effective prompt engineering can reduce frustration and improve engagement with the AI.

4. **Task-Specific Outputs**: Different tasks (like summarization, translation, or creative writing) require different approaches to prompting. Tailoring prompts for specific tasks can optimize the model's performance.

5. **Exploration of Capabilities**: By experimenting with various prompts, users can discover the full range of a model's capabilities, including its strength in creative tasks, technical questions, or conversational interactions.

6. **Mitigation of Bias**: Thoughtfully designed prompts can help minimize biases in AI responses, leading to fairer and more balanced interactions.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
### Example of a Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about a book."

### Improved Prompt:
"Summarize the main themes of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and explain how they relate to social justice."
